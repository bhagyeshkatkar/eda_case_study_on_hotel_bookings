- `Case_Study_Hotel_booking.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step EDA and visualizations.
- `Report_on_Hotel_Booking_Case_Study.docx` – A summarized report of key findings and business insights.
- `README.md` – Repository documentation.

## 🧪 Key Highlights

- 🏨 Comparison between City and Resort hotels.
- 📅 Trends in lead time, booking modifications, and cancellation behavior.
- 💰 Analysis of ADR (Average Daily Rate) by customer type, hotel type, and country.
- 📈 Correlation heatmaps and distribution visualizations.
- ✅ Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA) to support data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
